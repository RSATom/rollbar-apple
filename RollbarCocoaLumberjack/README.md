# RollbarCocoaLumberjack


This SDK module implements integration of Rollbar into the popular CocoaLumberjack logging framework.

So if you either already use CocoaLumberjack or you are planning to use it for your software product logging needs, 
then you can easily integrate Rollbar into it via this module and have all or some of the logs performed via the 
CocoaLumberjack framework redirected into a dedicated Rollbar project at www.rollbar.com and monitor the health of
your own software product/service remotely.
